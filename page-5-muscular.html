       <p>MUSCULAR SYSTEM <br> ________________ <br>
        <br>
        
        the integrated action of joints, bones, and 
        skeletal muscles produces obvious movements 
        such as walking and running. skeletal muscles 
        also produce more subtle movements that result 
        in various facial expressions, eye movements, and respiration.
        posture, such as sitting and standing, is maintained 
        as a result of muscle contraction. the skeletal muscles 
        are continually making fine adjustments that hold the 
        body in stationary positions. the tendons of many muscles 
        extend over joints and in this way contribute to joint 
        stability. this is particularly evident in the knee and 
        shoulder joints, where muscle tendons are a major factor 
        in stabilizing the joint. heat production, to maintain 
        body temperature, is an important by-product of muscle 
        metabolism. nearly 85 percent of the heat produced in 
        the body is the result of muscle contraction.</p>
