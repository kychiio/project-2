        exchanges oxygen 
        and carbon dioxide between the body and 
        the environment through the respiratory tract. 
        the right lung is divided into three lobes 
        (sections), and the left lung is divided into two 
        lobes. your left lung is slightly smaller 
        than your right lung, since your heart takes up 
        some space on the left side. when you breathe in, 
        air enters your airways and travels down into the 
        air sacs, or alveoli, in your lungs. alveoli are able to 
         easily expand and contract because their 
         insides are coated with a substance called 
         surfactant. surfactant reduces the work it takes 
         to breathe by helping the lungs inflate more 
         easily when you breathe in.
         each of these alveoli is made up of a mesh 
         of tiny blood vessels called capillaries. 
         the capillaries connect to a network of arteries 
         and veins that move blood through your body.
         carbon dioxide moves from the blood into the air
          inside the alveoli. at the same time, 
          oxygen moves from the air into the blood 
          in the capillaries. the lungs are surrounded
           by the pleura, a membrane with two layers. 
           the space between these two layers is called 
           the pleural cavity. a slippery liquid called 
           pleural fluid acts as a lubricant to reduce 
           friction during breathing.  </p>
